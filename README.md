# PROJECT_NAME

## The Idea

### Concept
It's time to explain what's your project about, explain what you're trying to achieve and why your project is worth.

### Brief
Explain the problem you're solving with this project, main benefits and advantages of using your software

### Licensing
You'll probably need to pick a license for your project. Decide if you'll create a free, open source, 

## Tools

### Programming Languages
Pick the language(s) you're going to work with within your project, optionally you can explain why you choose those languages.

### Libraries
Chose (if needed) the libraries you'll use to develop your project. Keep in mind that this should be a dynamic section of the plan

### Frameworks
If you feel you need a framework or two to accomplish what you want, list them here.

### Text Editor/IDE
Pick and setup a text editor or IDE to work on your project

### Providers
In this section, you can define what services and providers you plan to use with your project. Feel free to delete/edit/add any topic you need

#### Domain Name
Domain name provider and the domain name(s) you'll buy.

#### Hosting
Hosting requirements, provider, and selected plan

#### Accounts & licenses
Accounts and licenses you need for this project. e.g. `a GitHub account`.

## Design

### Look and Feel
Define/describe/design how your final application should look and how it should work. Describe how the user can interact with the application and the steps needed to accomplish a task. You can design every screen the user will see and describe each part of it.

### Entities
Think which entities are needed in your project, e.g. `A server`, `a Client`, `a User`.

### Features
List out what features will have your application, categorized as essential and nonessential.

#### Essential Features
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3
- Feature 4

#### Non-essential Features
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3
- Feature 4

## Initial Setup
Explain every step you should do in order to get ready to start the development, what tools you need to install/configure. e.g. `create a repository` or `install gnu c compiler`.

## Code Requirements
Let's start with the tricky part... Now it's time to plan the coding part itself.
Get started by giving some general aspect for the code you're going to write. Code style, standards to follow, paradigm to use, development method and/or version of the language to use. e.g. `Test Driven Development of Object oriented ES2018 JavaScript code following the Google style`.

### Architecture
Write down a list of one sentence-defined functions to implement. e.g. `function to register a user` or `function to change the user's password`.

### Pseudo-code
Write in pseudo-code the simplest implementation of every function defined in the Architecture section above. If you need more than just a few lines of pseudo code, maybe means that function can be spliced down into two or more 'mini-functions'.

## Schedule
Create a schedule with deadlines to each item in the Architecture item, keep in mind to assign a fair time to each piece of work, too much is bad, but, not enough is worst.
